# CS3500 Reversi
## EXTRA CREDIT CHANGES
For the extra credit assignment, we implemented all features
* Hints: players are able to toggle hints on or off using the 'h' key. Each player can turn hints on or off separately, though they will always see the hints for the current player.
* Square Reversi model: we have a model for a game of square Reversi that works with any positive, even-side length (not specified, but the side length must be at least 4 in order to place starting tiles). It implements the same interfaces as our hexagonal model. We also have a textual rendering for this model.
* Square Reversi GUI: we have a GUI view for square Reversi that displays properly and can be interacted with through clicks and key presses. It implements the same interfaces as our hexagonal view.
* Square Reversi controller: our controller from all previous assignments works with both square and hexagonal Reversi.
